Del.icio.us Extended API

ATTENTION
In the beginning of August '09, Delicious Website has changed. So, I had to change some features like "Posted By" method for the links in the front page.


USAGE:

d = Delicious::Collector.new
links = d.popular
links.each do |link|
  
  puts '------------------------------------------'
  puts "Text: #{link.text}"
  puts "URL: #{link.url}"
  puts "People: #{link.people}"  
  puts "Tags:  #{link.tags * ','}"
  
end
